# Fridge Friend React App

Fridge Friend is a recipe search React app which utilizes styled components and the Edamam recipe search API. This app is fully responsive.

## Motivation

After completing the Codecademy Web Development Career Path, this application serves as a "proof of knowledge" of the skills I gained during my course of study.

## Features

Grocery stores are gross! Limit trips to the grocery store by utilizing ingredients in your pantry and refrigerator. Type in one or all of the ingredients into the search bar to see what you can make. The top 20 recipes for your search are populated with links to each recipe.

Not ready to eat? Fridge Friend also has helpful suggestions for other ways to put those leftovers to work such as composting, donating, and crafting.

**Future Features**
- Account creation
- Ability to save recipes to a Favorites folder
- Expanded recipe information
